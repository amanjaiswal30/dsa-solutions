# ðŸ”¹ Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Given an array of strings `tokens` representing an arithmetic expression in **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)**, evaluate the expression and return the result.

- Valid operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
- Division should truncate towards zero.

**Example Inputs & Outputs**  
Input: `["2","1","+","3","*"]` â†’ Output: 9  
Explanation: `(2 + 1) * 3 = 9`

Input: `["4","13","5","/","+"]` â†’ Output: 6  
Explanation: `4 + (13 / 5) = 6`

Input: `["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]` â†’ Output: 22

## ðŸ’¡ Logic & Intuition
- Use a **stack** to store operands.
- Traverse tokens from left to right:
    1. If token is a number â†’ push onto the stack.
    2. If token is an operator â†’ pop two operands, perform operation, push result back.
- At the end, the stack contains a single result.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Approaches

### 1. Stack-Based Evaluation (Standard)
- Intuition:
    - Stack holds operands until an operator is encountered.
    - For each operator, pop the last two operands, apply the operation, and push the result back.

## ðŸ’» Java Code (All Approaches)

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class ReversePolishNotation {

    public int evalRPN(String[] tokens) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (String token : tokens) {
            if (token.equals("+")) {
                int b = stack.pop();
                int a = stack.pop();
                stack.push(a + b);
            } else if (token.equals("-")) {
                int b = stack.pop();
                int a = stack.pop();
                stack.push(a - b);
            } else if (token.equals("*")) {
                int b = stack.pop();
                int a = stack.pop();
                stack.push(a * b);
            } else if (token.equals("/")) {
                int b = stack.pop();
                int a = stack.pop();
                stack.push(a / b);
            } else {
                stack.push(Integer.parseInt(token));
            }
        }

        return stack.pop();
    }
}
```

## ðŸ’¡ Intuition Behind the Approach

- The **stack** keeps track of operands until an operator is encountered.
- When an operator appears, the **last two operands** are popped, the operation is applied, and the result is pushed back.
- This ensures the correct **order of operations** and works naturally for the RPN format.
- Handles all operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and negative numbers correctly.

## ðŸ“Š Complexity Analysis

| Approach               | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Stack-Based Evaluation | O(n)            | O(n)             |

- **n** = number of tokens in the input array.
- Each token is processed once, and the stack holds at most n/2 operands at any time.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Edge Cases
1. Single token â†’ simply return its integer value.
2. Division by zero â†’ should be avoided or handled (assume input is valid).
3. Negative numbers â†’ operations respect sign.
4. Empty input â†’ should return 0 or raise an exception depending on constraints.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Follow-Up Questions
1. Can you **evaluate RPN without using a stack** (e.g., recursion)?
2. How would you **support additional operators** like modulus `%` or exponent `^`?
3. How to **evaluate tokens in a streaming fashion**, one by one, without storing the whole array?
